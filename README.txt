Love Typing is a touch typing tutor written in Lua using
the LÖVE 2D API.  This is my first program using LÖVE 2D.

Love Typing is based on the TI-99/4a Touch Typing Tutor program
from the early 1980s.  This is the program from which I learned
touch typing.  I've been looking for a touch typing software for
my children but I have not found anything I like as well.
