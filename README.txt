Introdcution:

Love To Type is a touch typing tutor written in Lua
using the LÖVE 2D API.  This program is under active
development and is not feature complete yet.

Love To Type is based on the TI-99/4a Touch Typing Tutor
program from the early 1980s.  This is the program from
which I learned touch typing.  I've been looking for
touch typing software for my children but I have not
found anything I like as well.  

Installation:

The latest versions of LoveToType require LÖVE 0.7.2.
(Version 0.5 and earlier required LÖVE 0.6.2.) LÖVE
0.7.2 downloads for Mac, Linux and Windows are available
at http://love2d.org/.  After LÖVE 0.7.2 has been
installed you can download the latest version of the
LoveToType.love file from the the download link at
http://github.com/bblodget/LoveToType/.  Once the file had
been downloaded, simply double-click it to run it.
