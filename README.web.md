## Deploying to a Web Server

To deploy to a web server, copy the contents of the `web-dist` directory to your web server's public directory. Make sure your server is configured to send the proper CORS headers:

```
Header set Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy "same-origin"
Header set Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy "require-corp"
```

For Apache servers, you can use the included `.htaccess` file in the `web-dist` directory.
